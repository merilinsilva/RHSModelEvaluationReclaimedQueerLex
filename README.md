# RHSModelEvaluationReclaimedQueerLex

This contains the ReclaimedQueerLex dataset by Rebecca Dorn et al. [1] and a Python script, which preprocesses the dataset and evaluates it using a hate speech detection model, fine-tuned on LGBTQ+ reclaimed language called the RHS model.

In the end the code for a LateX table is outputed with the Precision, Recall and F1-Score of hate and non-hate labels, given by Detoxify, Perspective and the RHS model.
